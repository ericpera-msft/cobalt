# Azure Storage

This Terraform based `storage-account` module grants templates the ability to configure and deploy cloud `storage containers` along with a `storage account` using Microsoft's _**Azure Storage**_ service.

In addition, this module offers both authentication and authorization features:

- For authentication, this module automatically enrolls the deployed `storage account` into Microsoft's _**Managed Identities**_ service.

- For authorization, this module expects to receive the `object id` of any Azure Resource that will behave as a client of the `storage-account`. Enrollment as an Azure Resource client is achieved through Microsoft's _**Role Based Access Secruity**_ (RBAC) service.

#### _More on Azure Storage_

> "A storage account provides a unique namespace in Azure for your data. Every object that you store in Azure Storage has an address that includes your unique account name. A container organizes a set of blobs, similar to a directory in a file system. A storage account can include an unlimited number of containers, and a container can store an unlimited number of blobs." - Source: Microsoft's [Introduction to Azure Blob Storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blobs-introduction)

This module deploys a `storage account` along with `storage containers` in order to satisfy blob storage scenarios which are optimized for storing massive amounts of unstructured data, such as text or binary data.

## Characteristics

An instance of the `storage-account` module deploys the _**Azure Storage**_ service in order to provide templates with the following:

- Ability to deploy a Storage Account automatically enrolled into _**Managed Identities**_ within a single resource group.

- Ability to deploy a Storage Account with a role assigned Azure Resource client.

- Ability to deploy Storage Containers alongside deploying a Storage Account.

## Definition

Terraform resources directly referenced within the `storage-account` module include the following:

- [azurerm_storage_account](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/r/storage_account.html)

- [azurerm_storage_container](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/r/storage_container.html)

## Usage

Azure Storage usage example:

```terraform
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "main" {
  name     = var.prefix
  location = var.resource_group_location
}

module "service_plan" {
  source              = "../../modules/providers/azure/service-plan"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.main.name
  service_plan_name   = "${azurerm_resource_group.main.name}-sp"
}

module "app_service" {
  source              = "../../modules/providers/azure/app-service"
  app_service_name    = var.app_service_name
  service_plan_name   = module.service_plan.service_plan_name
  ...
}

module "storage_account" {
  source                    = "../../modules/providers/azure/storage-account"
  resource_group_name       = azurerm_resource_group.main.name
  resource_group_location   = azurerm_resource_group.main.location
  account_name              = "mystorageaccount"
  storage_container_names   = ["pictures", "movies"]
  encryption_source         = "Microsoft.Storage"
  existing_sp_object_id     = module.app_service.app_service_identity_object_ids[0]
}
```
